            We are a ragtag team of self-proclaimed idiots who thrive on chaos, laughter, and the occasional strategic brilliance. United by our love for the game Squad, we're a chill community that knows how to turn even the most serious situations into opportunities for banter. Here, comradery and brotherhood are the pillars of our group, and under the "benevolent" dictatorship of Bischop, we march (or stumble) into battle with unmatched enthusiasm. Whether you're a seasoned vet or a clueless noob, you'll find a place in our ranks where the only thing taken seriously is having fun. Join us, and let's turn the battlefield into our playground!
